    "1. Just because we can define variables in loops (like when `range()` or `zip()` or `enumerate()` are used) doesn't mean we need to use them. Sometimes you'll see `_` used as the loop variable when it doesn't matter what it's called, but you still need to assign a variable for a function call or something else to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any file that's open where you have access to the handle (called `outputfile` in the above example), or anything that can be wrapped with an `iter()` to make it **iterable**, can have the `next()` function called on it to return the next item. In the case of files, you iterate over the lines one by one (separated by newlines). That's why I have the statement `for line in outputfile:`, where `outputfile` is the iterator and `line` is the variable that contains whatever the latest item is from the `outputfile` iterator.\n",

    "1. Keep as much stuff inside functions as possible. If a function has more than a handful of functions, it's either too big or just shouldn't be a function. These only take one or two arguments.\n",
    "2. There are quite a few loops, most of them nested, which can be a problem, but the *control flow* for finding specific lines in files is very explicit. This is a better alternative to reading in the file, splitting the whole thing on newlines, wrapping in an iterator, calling `next()` a fixed number of times, etc.\n",
    "3. A balance between being very specific and very general. This mostly comes from practice and experience."
